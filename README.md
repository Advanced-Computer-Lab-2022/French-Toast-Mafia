## Online Learning System
Online Learning System is a web application through which individuals can attend pre-recorded courses online. :books: :man_teacher:
## Motivation :zap:
This project aim was to help us: <br/>
• Learn how to properly use the Agile Methodology to plan out a project and develop the software. <br/>
• Learn the process of following a given set of System Requirements to develop a software and work together as a Team on Github. <br/>
• Learn to research and master the use of the MERN Stack. <br/>
## Build Status :hammer_and_wrench:
This basically explains the current build status of the project. If there is a bug /error which needs addressing. This is done so for two different reasons The user understands that this is an issue and does not spend more time figuring if it was a mistake on their part.A developer who is familiar with the issue can suggest some solutions directly without going through the whole code.
## Code Style :sunglasses:
Our code style is a standard code style.
## Screenshots :camera_flash:
As the saying goes, a picture is equal to a thousand words. Most people will be interested if there is a visual representation of what the project is about. It helps them understand better. A visual representation can be snapshots of the project or a video of the functioning of the project.
## Tech/Framework used :bulb:
We used [MERN Stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) to implement this project. <br/>

<strong>MERN<strong> stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. <br/>
MongoDB — document database. <br/>
Express(.js) — Node.js web framework. <br/>
React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework. <br/>
Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server. <br/>
