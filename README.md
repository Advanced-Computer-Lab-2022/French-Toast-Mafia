## Online Learning System :books: 
Online Learning System is a web application through which individuals can attend pre-recorded courses online. :man_teacher:
## Motivation :zap:
This project aim was to help us: <br/>
• Learn how to properly use the Agile Methodology to plan out a project and develop the software. <br/>
• Learn the process of following a given set of System Requirements to develop a software and work together as a Team on Github. <br/>
• Learn to research and master the use of the MERN Stack. <br/>
## Build Status :hammer_and_wrench:
• For the user, he'll only be able to report a problem or rate the instructor, but in the future we intend to build a chat system between the users and their instructors
## Code Style :sunglasses:
Our code style is a standard code style.

## Tech/Framework used :bulb:
We used [MERN Stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) to implement this project. <br/>

<strong>MERN<strong> stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. <br/>
MongoDB — document database. <br/>
Express(.js) — Node.js web framework. <br/>
React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework. <br/>
Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server. <br/>
